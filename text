Comprehensive Biographical and Professional Intelligence Report: Samuel Paluba1. Executive Intelligence Summary and Profile OverviewThe subject of this comprehensive analysis is Samuel Paluba, a prominent emerging figure in the Czech technology, entrepreneurship, and libertarian activist sectors. Born on June 29, 2009 1, Paluba represents a distinct archetype of the high-agency "digital native" who has successfully parallel-processed secondary education with the establishment of a complex commercial and civic portfolio. By late 2025, at the age of 16, Paluba had consolidated his position as the Chief Executive Officer of ThinkHome s.r.o., a Managed Service Provider (MSP) and software development firm headquartered in Prague.3 Simultaneously, he occupies a strategic leadership role within the international Students For Liberty organization and maintains a freelance career in political media documentation.4This report synthesizes extensive data from internal business documentation, personal portfolios, email correspondence, and digital artifacts to reconstruct Paluba's professional architecture. The analysis reveals a subject who operates with a high degree of strategic intentionality, leveraging his youth not as a liability but as a market differentiator—framing his ventures as agile, innovative, and unburdened by legacy corporate inefficiencies. His activities are characterized by a seamless integration of technical competence (specifically in the React/Next.js ecosystem and AI deployment), ideological advocacy (Austrian economics and free-market libertarianism), and commercial pragmatism (regulatory compliance services and hardware lifecycle management).The following sections provide an exhaustive detailing of his personal history, the operational mechanics of his business enterprises, his technical stack, and his strategic outlook as of December 2025.2. Developmental History and Educational Trajectory2.1 Demographics and Personal BackgroundSamuel Paluba resides in the Prague 4 district, specifically at Rytířova 777/3, 143 00, a location that serves a dual purpose as both his domestic residence and the registered legal seat of his primary business entity, ThinkHome s.r.o..1 This co-location is typical of early-stage entrepreneurial ventures where overhead minimization is a priority. Legal documentation from early 2025 identifies Monika Palubová Všetečková as his legal guardian, a necessary legal structure given his minor status during the incorporation and initial operational phases of his commercial activities.12.2 Academic Foundations: SSPŠaGPaluba’s academic career is centered at the Smíchovská střední průmyslová škola a gymnázium (SSPŠaG), an institution he credits with shaping his professional trajectory.1 His selection of this specific school was not incidental; he explicitly cites the influence of Albert Vala, encountered during the National Scout Jamboree in 2023, as the catalyst for his decision to attend.6 This indicates an early susceptibility to peer mentorship and a decisive approach to educational choices based on networking opportunities rather than proximity or tradition.His engagement with SSPŠaG transcends the standard curriculum, functioning effectively as an incubator for his technical and organizational skills. His academic portfolio is characterized by high-intensity extracurricular involvement:Hackathon Leadership: Paluba has moved beyond mere participation to organizational roles. He was instrumental in "Hackdays 1" and "Hackdays 2" in 2023 and the specialized "Hackdays Linux Networks" in 2025.1 This specific focus on Linux networking suggests a foundational interest in infrastructure and systems administration, which later manifested in his MSP business offerings.Specialized Technical Immersion: He has aggressively pursued supplementary education through the school’s summer programs. In 2023, he attended the "Summer School of Cybernetics" and the "Summer School of 3D Printing," diversifying his hardware and systems knowledge. In 2024, he pivoted to software and emerging tech with the "Summer School of AI".1 This progression—from hardware/cybernetics to software/AI—mirrors the broader market shift and his own company's service evolution.Stratospheric Research: Demonstrating a capacity for complex logistical planning, Paluba participated in the "Dotkni se Vesmíru" (Touch the Space) project. This initiative involved the organization of a stratospheric probe launch and its subsequent recovery.1 Such projects require multidisciplinary coordination (telemetry, physics, logistics), serving as a practical training ground for his later project management endeavors.2.3 Scouting and the Formation of Leadership EthosBefore his entry into the technology sector, Paluba’s character and leadership style were forged within the scouting movement. He was a long-term member and subsequently a "Rádce" (Patrol Leader) in the 145. oddíl Naděje Praha.1The analysis of his personal reflections reveals that he views scouting not merely as a recreational activity but as a crucial developmental phase for his cognitive framework. He explicitly links his time in the unit to the development of "freedom of thought" and "critical thinking," traits he identifies as essential for his future.6 His scouting resume is robust, indicating a high level of commitment and physical resilience:Leadership Training: He completed specialized leadership courses, including "Shania" and "Ostříž," designed to equip young leaders with pedagogical and organizational skills.6Physical Endurance: He participated in the "Přechod Brd" (Brdy Crossing) repeatedly in 2022, 2023, and 2024, as well as the "Roverský Miquik 2024".6 These winter survival events suggest a capacity for endurance and functioning under adverse conditions.3. Commercial Enterprise Architecture: ThinkHome s.r.o.The central pillar of Paluba's professional identity is his role as CEO of ThinkHome s.r.o. (IČO: 23893591). By late 2025, this entity had evolved from a student project into a formally structured Managed Service Provider (MSP) with a sophisticated business plan, marketing strategy, and service catalog. The following analysis dissects the company's structure based on internal strategic documents from late 2025.3.1 Corporate Strategy and Market PositioningThinkHome s.r.o. positions itself as a comprehensive "All-in-one IT Partner" specifically targeting the Small and Medium Business (SMB/MSP) sector, defined as companies with 5 to 50 employees.3 The core strategic insight driving the business is the "Digital Gap" in the Czech market: small firms are too large to rely on ad-hoc solutions but too small to afford a dedicated internal IT department.The "Turn-key" Value Proposition:Paluba's strategy is built around the concept of "IT bez starostí" (IT without worries). The business model is designed to relieve the client's management of all technical cognitive load. The internal documentation identifies three specific pain points the company addresses:Management Time Loss: Business owners wasting time on non-core activities like fixing printers or Wi-Fi.3Infrastructure Chaos: Lack of standardization, poor asset tracking, and reactive purchasing.3Security Risk: Vulnerability to ransomware and data loss due to professional negligence.3Strategic Differentiation:Crucially, ThinkHome turns its potential weakness—the youth of its team—into its primary strength. The "About Us" narrative drafts explicitly frame the team as "digital natives" born in the classroom and built for business.7 They contrast themselves against traditional IT firms which are portrayed as "slow and expensive," positioning ThinkHome as agile, modern, and aligned with the "startup world" energy.73.2 Service Ecosystem and Revenue PillarsThe company's service architecture is remarkably mature, categorized into eight distinct pillars that cover the entire lifecycle of corporate IT.Service PillarOperational Details & Strategic Insight1. Turn-key IT ManagementThis is the core recurring revenue engine. It involves complete delegation of IT responsibilities. The service includes 24/7 remote monitoring, user account management, and a guarantee of <2 hour response times for critical issues.32. Cloud & CommunicationThinkHome acts as a broker and administrator for major ecosystems. The strategy targets a "Dual Hyperscaler" status—aiming for both Google Premier Partner and Microsoft Solutions Partner designations.3 This "ecosystem agnosticism" allows them to capture a wider market share. They also deploy VoIP systems (3CX) to reduce telephony costs by up to 80%.33. Cybersecurity & ComplianceLeveraging the regulatory environment, specifically the upcoming NIS2 directive and ZoKB (Law on Cyber Security). ThinkHome sells "Compliance Peace of Mind," offering audits, penetration testing, and MFA implementation.3 This creates high-margin consulting opportunities on top of standard support.4. Network InfrastructureA strong technical preference for Ubiquiti / UniFi technology is evident.3 Paluba specializes in designing robust Wi-Fi and LAN networks using this specific hardware stack, likely due to its balance of enterprise features and SMB price points.5. Hardware Lifecycle (Circular Economy)A distinguishing feature is the "Profit Sharing" buy-back model. ThinkHome buys retired corporate fleets, sanitizes data to NIST 800-88 standards, refurbishes the units, and returns 20% of the net resale profit to the client.7 This targets the "Green Procurement" mandate of modern firms.6. Web & Software DevelopmentThe firm offers a two-tier web development service. Standard: WordPress/Breakdance for rapid deployment. Advanced: Custom Next.js web applications for scalability.3 This segmentation allows them to service both the local café and the scaling startup.7. AI Automation & ConsultingPositioning themselves at the cutting edge, they offer custom chatbot development and "Prompt Engineering" training.3 This service is designed to modernize client workflows and justify premium consulting fees.8. Training & EducationThey monetize their knowledge base by offering training on cybersecurity hygiene (Phishing) and AI efficiency, creating an additional revenue stream while deepening client lock-in.33.3 Brand Psychology and Design SystemsIn November 2025, Paluba authorized a comprehensive "Website Design & Marketing Plan" that reveals a sophisticated understanding of brand psychology.7 The plan dictates a move away from the traditional "IT Blue" tropes toward a "Swiss-style" modern aesthetic.Visual Identity: The brand utilizes the Satoshi font family (Black/Bold/Regular) to convey geometric precision and authority. The color palette is strictly high-contrast "Onyx Black" and "Paper White," punctuated by a "Signal Red" (#FF0000) derived from the logo.7Psychological Signaling:Red: Used exclusively for "Action" and "Alerts" (e.g., "Get Help Now"), triggering an immediate cognitive response suitable for emergency IT support.7Green: A secondary "Eco-Green" palette is reserved only for the Hardware Repurposing section, cognitively separating the sustainability mission from the core infrastructure business.7Glassmorphism: The navigation bar employs a blurred background effect to maintain a modern, high-tech feel while ensuring legibility.7User Persona Routing: The website is architected to immediately segment traffic into three flows:The Panic Button: For the "Overwhelmed Business Owner" needing immediate fixes.The Calculator: For the "Procurement Manager" calculating buy-back returns.The Digital Handyman: For household users needing simple services.73.4 Operational Infrastructure and Tech StackThinkHome’s internal technical choices reflect Paluba’s preference for modern, scalable tools. The "Tech Stack" specified in the design documents serves as both a toolset and a portfolio piece 7:Frontend Framework: Next.js 14 (App Router) is the standard, chosen for its Server-Side Rendering (SSR) capabilities which optimize SEO and load times.7Styling: Tailwind CSS allows for rapid, utility-first design implementation.7CMS: Headless solutions like Sanity.io or Strapi are preferred to decouple content from code, allowing marketing teams to operate independently.7Hosting: Vercel is the deployment platform of choice, ensuring global edge caching.7Analytics: Privacy-focused tools like PostHog or Plausible are selected over Google Analytics to ensure strict GDPR compliance, a key selling point for their European client base.73.5 Organizational Structure and Human CapitalThinkHome is not a solo endeavor. The internal business plan lists a structured executive team, assigning specific domains to each member 3:RoleNameResponsibilitiesCEO & IT ConsultantSamuel PalubaOverall strategy, sales, vision, and lead consulting.CTO & Cybersecurity ExpertOndřej JansaTechnical architecture, Next.js lead, and security auditing.Hardware Lead & WordPressVojtěch PellManagement of the refurbishment center ("Circular Economy") and standard web builds.Senior Full-Stack DeveloperErdic DaskinCustom web application development and UI/UX implementation.Design & MarketingKateřina BřeňováVisual identity, campaign management, and user interface design.4. Technical Competencies and Development ProjectsPaluba’s technical expertise is not limited to management; he possesses a "hands-on" engineering skill set that spans software development, AI integration, and network engineering. This technical depth allows him to bridge the gap between business requirements and engineering reality.4.1 Artificial Intelligence and Large Language Models (LLMs)Paluba is an active participant in the Czech-Slovak AI community, collaborating with notable figures such as Juraj Bednár and Pavol Ľupták to organize meetups and discussions.1 His work in this domain is practical and application-oriented:WalterGPT Project: Developed during the SSPŠ Summer School in 2024, this project involved the fine-tuning of a Llama 3.1 7b model. Paluba trained the model to emulate the speech patterns and personality of "Walter White" from the series Breaking Bad.6 Technically, this required scripting an API to serve the model to a client application, demonstrating proficiency in Python, model quantization, and backend API design.OllamaCollabApi: Addressing the barrier to entry for open-source AI, Paluba created a script that allows non-technical users to run and modify models from the OLLAMA database using the free tier of Google Collab.6 This project highlights a "democratization" ethos, creating tools that make complex tech accessible to laypeople—a philosophy that mirrors his business approach.4.2 Web Development and Modern StacksHis GitHub activity and business design documents confirm a strong specialization in the React ecosystem. He has moved beyond traditional LAMP stacks to modern JAMstack architectures. His specific focus on Next.js suggests an understanding of the need for hybrid rendering strategies (static vs. dynamic) to balance performance and interactivity.74.3 Network EngineeringPaluba’s portfolio consistently references Linux Networks and Ubiquiti systems.1 His participation in "Hackdays Linux Networks" in 2025 indicates a continued deepening of his knowledge in system administration.2 In a professional context, this translates to the ability to design VLANs, configure VPNs for remote work (a key service offering), and manage physical layer infrastructure for SMB clients.5. Political Activism and Civic EngagementParallel to his commercial pursuits, Paluba is a dedicated activist within the libertarian movement. This ideological commitment is not a sideline hobby but a core component of his public identity, influencing his professional network and business ethics.5.1 Students For Liberty (SFL) LeadershipSince 2023, Paluba has served as a Local Coordinator for Students For Liberty, an international non-profit advocating for free markets, individual rights, and limited government.4 His role is operational and strategic, involving the management of social media channels, IT infrastructure (servers, payment gateways), and event logistics.Key Initiatives and Events:Conference "Legalizujme" (October 2024): Paluba was involved in organizing this conference focused on drug policy reform. The event advocated for a "harm reduction" approach and analyzed the economic futility of prohibition.4Interview with Tiananmen Square Organizer (November 2024): He conducted a high-profile interview with an organizer of the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests, demonstrating an interest in global human rights and historical resistance to authoritarianism.6LibertyCon 2025: He is tasked with partner coordination and promotion for this major international gathering, scheduled for April 2025.45.2 Ideological Framework: The Austrian SchoolPaluba explicitly aligns himself with the Austrian School of Economics.1 This heterodox economic school emphasizes methodological individualism and the importance of price signals. This philosophical grounding informs his interest in Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies, which he views as practical applications of Austrian economic theory.Crypto-Anarchy and Parallel Structures:His involvement in the crypto space is significant. He served as a "Runner" at BTC Prague (June 2024) and was a core organizer of the Chain Camp conference in Ostrava (October 2024).1 These events are central hubs for the European crypto-anarchist community, suggesting Paluba is deeply embedded in networks that seek to build "parallel structures" outside of state control.5.3 Debating and Intellectual DevelopmentPaluba is a member of the debate club associated with Debatní deník (Timofej Kožuchov).1 He credits this experience with refining his rhetorical skills and ability to construct logical arguments. This background is evident in his business communication, which is structured, persuasive, and value-focused.6. Media Presence and Communication StrategyPaluba maintains a secondary professional identity as a photographer and videographer, often merging this creative skillset with his political interests to generate unique content.6.1 Photography and Videography PortfolioHe lists "Artistic Photography" and "Video Editing" as key competencies, utilizing professional-grade software like Adobe Premiere and Final Cut.6 His creative output is largely functional, serving his activist goals; he produces documentation for SFL events and creates short-form video content (TikTok) to propagate libertarian ideas to a younger audience.66.2 The October 2025 Media Outreach CampaignIn early October 2025, Paluba executed a coordinated cold-email campaign targeting the heavyweights of Czech media. He sent personalized pitches to Respekt, Aktuálně.cz, Deník Alarm, Reflex, Česká televize, and Seznam Zprávy.5Analysis of the Pitch:Transparency: He explicitly introduced himself as "16 years old," using his age to signal precocity and energy rather than hiding it.5The Offer: He proposed an external collaboration to provide photo reportage of "political and live events."The Strategy: By stating he was "not looking for employment" but rather a "cooperative form" of engagement, he positioned himself as an independent contractor—a peer rather than a subordinate. This mirrors his B2B approach with ThinkHome.Targeting: The breadth of the list—from the public broadcaster (ČT) to the leftist Deník Alarm and the mainstream Seznam—shows a pragmatic, non-partisan approach to business development in the media sector.7. Strategic Synthesis and Future OutlookAs of late 2025, Samuel Paluba stands at a pivotal intersection of education, commerce, and activism. His trajectory suggests a deliberate strategy to professionalize every aspect of his life.Key Strategic Vectors:The "Student Advantage" Pivot: Paluba has mastered the art of framing his student status as a competitive advantage. In his business marketing, "student" equals "innovative, cheap, and energetic." In his media pitches, "16-year-old" equals "prodigy."Regulatory Arbitrage: His business model for ThinkHome heavily relies on the anxiety surrounding the NIS2 directive. He is effectively selling regulatory compliance services to SMBs that are unprepared for the new legal environment, positioning his firm as the bridge to legality.Ecosystem Lock-in: By pursuing dual partnership status with Google and Microsoft, and integrating hardware buy-backs, he is building a business model with extremely high "switching costs" for his clients. Once ThinkHome manages a company's licenses, network, and hardware disposal, decoupling becomes difficult, ensuring long-term revenue.Ideological Consistency: There is no friction between his activism and his business. His libertarian beliefs (free markets, crypto) fuel his business sector choices (independent MSP, crypto conferences), and his business profits likely fund his activist time.Conclusion:Samuel Paluba is a highly sophisticated operator for his age. He possesses a rare combination of "hard" technical skills (Next.js, Linux, AI) and "soft" political skills (debating, organizing, networking). His ability to manage a team, execute complex technical deployments, and navigate the political media landscape suggests a high potential for future leadership roles in the Czech technology or political sectors. His ventures are not merely learning experiments but viable commercial entities with structured growth plans, legal compliance strategies, and clear value propositions.8.

- **Výsledek:** Plně funkční chatbot s API endpointem pro integraci do klientských aplikací.

## 🔓 OllamaCollabApi
Nástroj pro demokratizaci přístupu k lokálním LLM.
- **Problém:** Spouštění lokálních modelů (jako Llama 3) vyžaduje silný HW, který studenti často nemají.
- **Řešení:** Skript, který umožňuje běžným uživatelům spouštět a upravovat modely z **OLLAMA** databáze využitím free tieru **Google Colab**.
- **Dopad:** Zpřístupnění pokročilých AI modelů pro non-tech uživatele bez nutnosti vlastnit GPU.

## 🤖 ThinkHome AI
V rámci [[thinkhome|ThinkHome.org]] vyvíjíme:
- Custom chatboty pro zákaznickou podporu.
- Interní automatizaci procesů pomocí AI agentů.
- Školení **Prompt Engineeringu** pro firemní klienty.

### 2. Aktualizace konfigurace Quartz

Nakonec aktualizuji `quartz.config.ts`, aby web měl správný název, češtinu jako výchozí jazyk a správné nastavení.
