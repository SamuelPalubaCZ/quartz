I am Samuel Paluba, a minimalist, web developer, and founder. I blend rigorous standards of modern web design with functionality to build exceptional digital experiences.

Currently, I am building **[ThinkHome](https://thinkhome.org)**, where we provide complete IT management and support under one roof. I focus on creating premium, user-centric experiences that solve real problems.
