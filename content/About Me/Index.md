title: About Me
---

I am Samuel Paluba, a minimalist, web developer, and founder tailored by the rigorous standards of modern web design and functionality.

I focus on creating premium, user-centric experiences. My work spans from building innovative startups like **ThinkHome** to crafting digital identities that stand out.

I believe in the power of minimalism—cutting through the noise to deliver value.
