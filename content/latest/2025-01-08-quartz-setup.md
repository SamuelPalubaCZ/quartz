# Building a Quartz 4 Digital Garden

_Note: This is a sample entry based on the new setup._

Why Quartz 4? It's minimal, fast, and works beautifully with Obsidian.

## Setup Process

1. Initialize Quartz repository
2. Configure frontmatter
3. Organize content with folders and tags
4. Deploy to Netlify/GitHub Pages

## Philosophy

A digital garden is different from a blog. It's about:
- **Evergreen notes**: Content that evolves
- **Connections**: Linking ideas together
- **Discovery**: Letting visitors explore the graph

I'm moving to this setup to better reflect my learning process in public.
